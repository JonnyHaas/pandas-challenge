# pandas-challenge
KU Module 4

For the Pandas-Challenge, I initially think I misunderstood the assignment.  I started out by trying to modify the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb based upon the "hint", but after reading the module 4 assignment started over and built the script based upon the requirements described in the "District Summary" and the "School Summary".  After creating the summaries, I generated script for the Highest-Performing and Lowest-Performing Schools.  I then created script for Math scores by grade, and reading scores by grade. I then analyzed the scores by School spending and then used code provided to categorize spending based upon spending ranges in the bins.  The scores from given code was then used to create a spending summary showing average math and reading scores along with % passing math , % passing reading, and an overall % passing for both math and reading.  Per the instructions, I then created script for evaluating scores by school size.  A per_school_summary was then generated based upon bin code provided for school sizes. The schools were binned into small, medium, and Large school groups for a size_summary.  Lastly, script was written to calculate school performance based on the school type utilizing the per_School_summary.

Note: My script is not saved in the PyCitySchools folder per the instructions. I already had the path set when I realized the discrepency.

My script is saved as: Pandas-Challenge/Starter_Code/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb

My written report is a word document saved as Pandas-Challenge/PyCitySchools_Written_Report.doc

I utilized ChatGPT to help me write the scripts.
I consulted with classmate Bobbi Fletchall.
I asked questions of AskBCS Learning Assistant
